Description
===========

An overcomplicated webservice that reports what colours you are dragging over communicates this information to a supercollider instrument consisting of 3 oscillators being manipulated by RGB pixel values.

I dragged my mouse cusor over the image of the fault and then pixel data was converted into some sort of music.
